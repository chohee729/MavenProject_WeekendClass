		//Classes - Parent, Child/Sub Class
		//These concepts will work only if you design a Parent and respective Children Classes
		
		//Child class inherits come of the properties of the parent Class
		//Parent class does not inherit from the Child Class
		
		//Object acquires properties/behavior of its parent Object
		
		//Advantages:-
		//Code - Reusability
		//We can use Polymorphism
		
		//Disadvantage - 2 Classes are tightly coupled with each other
		
		//What you cannot inherit?
		//Private method
		//Constructor
		
		//Single Level, Multi-Level, Hierarchical
