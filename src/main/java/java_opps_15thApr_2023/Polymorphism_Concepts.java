	//Types:- 
	
	//Compile Time Polymorphism [ static polymorhpism]
	
	//How to achieve?
	//1. Method overloading
	//2. Method name should be same. Class should be same. Parameters or argument will be different.
	//3. Handled by the compiler
	//4. HAS - A Relationship
	
	//Run Time Polymorphism [ dynamic polymorphism]
	
	//How to achieve?
	//1. Inheritance
	//2. Method name should be same. Class obviously different. Class obviously different. para or args same
	//3. IS-A Relationship
	//4. Access modifier of child class overriding method should have higher or equivalent access compare to parent class method
